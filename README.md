Once a designer with pixels in hand,  
I took a sharp turn toward >terminal_ land.  
From machines learning in Python and SQL,  
To chasing down threats like a cyber sentinel®.   

Three years deep, fueled by the grind,  
With hands-on labs, I started to find🔎,  
Following the NIST framework, solving cyber crime  
It was more than just learning, but the mission over time. 

From vuln scans to threat detection flair,  
Each project builds with purpose and care.  
In a world that’s evolving byte by byte,  
I’ve found my calling—and it feels just right. 🌐
