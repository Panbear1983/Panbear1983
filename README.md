Once a designer with pixels in hand,  
I took a sharp turn toward the _`>terminal_`_ land.  
From machine learning in Python and SQL,  
Falling into the cybersecurity's rabbit hole.   

Four years deep, fueled by the learning grind,  
With hands-on lab projects, I started to find,  
Following the NIST framework, solving cyber crime  
It was more than just learning, but missions over time. 

From vuln scans to threat detection flair,  
Each project builds with purpose and care.  
In a world gets more danger byte by byte,  
I’ve found my calling and it feels just right🕵️‍♂️.
