My GitHub projects span data science to cybersecurity, but honestly, I've been diving deep into vibe coding lately. There's something damn satisfying about leveraging Cursor to orchestrate automation agents that actually work in the real world. 

From vulnerability scans to network attack simulations using Azure Sentinel and Microsoft Defender, I'm building systems that minimizing few clicks and hassles in my life - agents that parses and make decisions, not just follow scripts. Always eager to connect with others who share this passion for creating systems that actually make a difference. 🕵️‍♂️
